                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">1. Do not clear your browser cache, this will cause you to lose access to site.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">2. Automatic yearly hospital benefits are triggered by tabbing or clicking out of Child Daily Hospital Benefit.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">3. Benefits you do not want to show can be removed by clicking the star next to them or in the "Add/Remove" 
                drop down at the bottom. They can be added back here without having to re-enter what you previously typed in during that same
                presentation.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">4. GO FULL SCREEN! The other person doesn't need to see your search bar and favorites bar. Use F11 to make 
                your browser full screen. When presenting a slide, exit full screen browser with F11 and use full screen button in slide window.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">5. F11 for full screen while showing benefits only! If your browser is full screen and you attempt to make 
                your presentation slides full screen it will not function properly. You will need to refresh your page for slides to be able 
                to go full screen again.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">6. If F11 does not work then you have function lock enabled, that's fine. Instead use Fn + F11.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class='tips'>7. DO NOT close Take Over window unless you are done with it, this will clear out everything on it.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class='tips'>8. On the H34 + A71 there is a small presentation guide programmed in, this will allow you to easily present 
                the A71 followed by H34 without having to click back to the top. This will only work your first time through each presentation, 
                You will need to refresh to activate it again.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class="tips">9. Presentation will resize if your window goes below a certain size so you can still see it easily. Note: this 
                is triggered by the window resizing, if you open in an already small window just resize slightly to activate resizing.</a>
                <br><br>
                <a class='tips'>10. Breaking the Terms of Use will result in you losing further access to site. To regain access, first time 
                penalty is $250. Second time penalty is $1000. Further loss of access may be permanent.</a>
